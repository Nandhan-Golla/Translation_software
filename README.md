Project Description:
Our Project focuses on breaking language barriers by developing an offline AI-powered translation system that translates resource materials from English to various Indian regional languages. Unlike cloud-based solutions, our software
ensures high accuracy and cultural relevance without requiring an internet connection, making it ideal for remote areas with low connectivity.
Features:
AI-Powered Translation – Uses advanced Neural Machine Translation (NMT) models for context-aware translations.
Cultural & Linguistic Accuracy – Goes beyond word-to-word replacement, understanding grammar, idioms, and cultural nuances.
Optimized for Indian Languages – Supports multiple regional languages.
Efficient Processing – Translates sentences at an average speed of 0.8 seconds per sentence.
How It Works:
Preprocessing: The input text is cleaned, tokenized, and prepared for translation.
Translation Engine: Our AI model translates the text while preserving its meaning and context.
Output Generation: The final translation is structured into natural, readable sentences.
